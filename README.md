### Janet,
the assistant you needed, you asked for and worked for.

#### Initial Setup
Janet's are really bad at first. They are like babies that you have to take care of and teach. They are naive, at first!

The initial setup is one of the most crucial part of owning a Janet. Anything you teach Janet in it's first life cycle will stick the most!

#### Continous Setup

Janet's are bound to be restarted; just like your computer when it's "frozen" or your phone when it's not functioning properly. Janet is by it's nature also a part of silicone world. It needs restarts from time to time; but never worry! It wakes up even wiser every time, learning from experiences it went through!

#### Warning

Janet might get too powerful as an intelligent being but it **does not** have a conscious mind. It's gonna try it's best to convince you! Don't be a fool. Don't fall into Janet's traps!

###### disclaimer: it's not a serious project.
